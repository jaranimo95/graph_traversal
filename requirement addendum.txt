Hello all,

There is a slight issue with the description of project 4.  In describing the lowest latency path problem, the time required to traverse an edge was described as:

"... the product of speed at which data can be send along a connection of that type and the length of the cable represented by that edge."

Clearly, this is an error, as the time would be computed as length / speed, not length * speed.  Hence, you should treat time required to traverse an edge as:

"... the length of the cable represented by that edge divided by the speed at which data can be send along a connection of that type."

Note that this change will not be updated to the project description on GitHub to avoid introducing any additional commits into your git histories.

To accommodate any changes that you may need to make to account for this error, I am extending the project deadline by 1 day to 4-4 @ 11:59PM.

Apologies for any confusion,
Dr. Farnan
